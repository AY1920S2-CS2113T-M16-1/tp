##ATAS - Documentation

### 1. Introduction
We use Markdown for writing documentataion.

> **Note**: <br/>
> We choose Markdown over asciidoc, although asciidoc provides more flexibility in formatting because Markdown is easier 
>to master for new developers.<br/>

### 2. Editing documentation
See [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) to learn the basic syntax for Markdown.
To preview your changes to your Markdown documents, you could download the Markdown plugin for IntelliJ, that allows 
you to preview your changes real-time. Alternatively, you could push the changes to `GitHub` and view the changes from 
your commits. 

### 3. Editing diagrams

own diagrams.

### 4. Publishing Documentation

2. Make a pull request to [here](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113T-M16-1/tp) to request for changes to be made to the
