== Design
This section will give a high-level overview of how various components in ATAS function and interact with each other.

=== Architecture
The following sections will explain each component in greater detail.

=== Atas Component
The sequence diagram below shows how various components in the Atas class interact when the user enters a `help` command

The Atas Class contains the main logic for ATAS. +
1. Atas uses the UI class to read user input. +
2. The Parser class is used to parse the user input string, returning a Command object. +
3. The Command's execute() method is run, returning a CommandResult object. +
4. Atas then uses the UI class to show the CommandResult's message to the user. +
5. Finally, Atas uses the Storage object to save the new state of the application.


=== UI Component

=== Parser Component
image::parser class diagram v1.PNG[Parser Class Diagram]
1. The Atas class uses the Parser class' static parseCommand() method to parse user commands. +
2. The Parser class' parseCommand() method then returns the appropriate Command object depending on the user input.

=== Storage Component
image::storage.PNG[Storage Class Diagram]
1. A Storage object is created by the Atas class to handle the loading and saving of task data.
2. The load() method is used to read saved data from a local file into the current session of ATAS.
3. The save() method writes the current state of ATAS into the local save file using the Task.encodeTask() method.

=== Command Component

=== CommandResult Component

== Implementation
=== Delete Command
image::delete.png[Delete Command sequence diagram]
Design Considerations: +
1. Loop through the ArrayList to get the task at the specified index and delete from the index
2. Use `remove` method to delete the task at a specified index

We implemented the 2nd option for deleting of tasks. This is because:
* Both methods have similar time and space complexities, but the 2nd method is much easier to implement as compared
to the 1st method

=== Search Command
*Step 1.* +
The Parser Class will call `prepareDeleteCommand` method and process the `task type` and `search query`

[NOTE]
`task type` refers to `all`,`event' or `assignment`

*Step 2.* +
`prepareSearchCommand method` will create a new `SearchCommand` class

*Step 3.* +
`SearchCommand` class will check the `task type` and calls their respective methods. In each of the respective methods, an ArrayList is used
to store the original index of the results.

* If `task type` is *all*, `SearchCommand` class will call the `getSearchQueryAllTasks` method and returns an ArrayList of the results.

* if `task type` is *event*, `SearchCommand` class will call the `getSearchQueryEvents` method and returns an ArrayList of the results.
This section will detail how some noteworthy features are implemented.

* if `task type` is *assignment*, `SearchCommand` class will call the `getSearchQueryAssignments` and returns an ArrayList of all the results.

*Step 4.* +
`SearchCommand` class calls the `searchList` method to format the results of the search query into a String format

*Step 5.* +
`SearchCommand` class calls the `resultsList` method to print the results of the search query, and creates a new `IncorrectCommand`
class to print the success message


[WARNING]
if there are no results to the search query or if there are no tasks in the task list, `SearchCommand` class
will create a new `IncorrectCommand` class to print the error messages
