== Design
This section will give a high-level overview of how various components in ATAS function and interact with each other.

=== Architecture
The following sections will explain each component in greater detail.

=== Atas Component
The sequence diagram below shows how various components in the Atas class interact when the user enters a `help` command

The Atas Class contains the main logic for ATAS. +
1. Atas uses the UI class to read user input. +
2. The Parser class is used to parse the user input string, returning a Command object. +
3. The Command's execute() method is run, returning a CommandResult object. +
4. Atas then uses the UI class to show the CommandResult's message to the user. +
5. Finally, Atas uses the Storage object to save the new state of the application.


=== UI Component

=== Parser Component
image::parser class diagram v1.PNG[Parser Class Diagram]
1. The Atas class uses the Parser class' static parseCommand() method to parse user commands. +
2. The Parser class' parseCommand() method then returns the appropriate Command object depending on the user input.

=== Storage Component
image::storage.PNG[Storage Class Diagram]
1. A Storage object is created by the Atas class to handle the loading and saving of task data.
2. The load() method is used to read saved data from a local file into the current session of ATAS.
3. The save() method writes the current state of ATAS into the local save file using the Task.encodeTask() method.

=== Command Component

=== CommandResult Component

== Implementation
This section will detail how some noteworthy features are implemented.
